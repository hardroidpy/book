\chapter*{Abstract}
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a research topic broadly covered in the last decade for its relevance in areas where the usersâ€™ context is important to build interactive applications. Smartphone applications have the capability to collect data from the environment and along with algorithms that take advantage of context-aware information becomes a powerful development platform. In this paper, we propose a HAR System denominated HARDroid that is specifically designed to detect common user activities. Furthermore, data collected from users on ground are taken into account to improve the activity recognition classifier. HARDroid is freely available as a library that may be included in Android applications. Finally, an evaluation that comparing the initial classifier with an improved classifier is presented, achieving a recall of 91.34\% and a precision of 92.04\%.
